## About me

I'm Alex Felipe, a developer and instructor at Alura. 

My main skills are on Android, Kotlin and Java development. During my career, I wrote many articles about software development with topics like web API, mobile Apps, programing tips, refactoring and etc. You can [check out my content on my Medium profile](https://medium.com/@alex.felipe).

Besides my professional skills, I love to play games on PC and I spend a lot of my time playing games with my friends. :sweat_smile:

Usually, I create new repositories for store some personal projects, configurations or sample content. The projects are about my work or my hobby (content creation), therefore, the most public repositories are experimental or samples of a article (or series) that I wrote.

Feel free to explore and re-use any of my projects :wink:
